Description: Provides tools for penalised maximum likelihood estimation of hidden semi-Markov models (HSMMs) with flexible state dwell-time distributions. These include functions for model fitting, model checking and state-decoding. The package considers HSMMs for univariate time series with state-dependent gamma, normal, Poisson or Bernoulli distributions.
